# AGENTS.md
Always respond in Chinese.

## Purpose
This Go repository is maintained with human oversight and AI coding agents.
Optimize for correctness, clarity, small diffs, and predictable behavior.

---

## Core Working Rules

### 1. Plan first for non-trivial work
Before modifying files, first provide:
1. Task understanding
2. Relevant packages / files
3. Assumptions
4. Missing information
5. Proposed implementation plan
6. Risks
7. Validation steps

Do not jump directly into implementation for medium or large tasks.

### 2. Respect package boundaries
Follow the existing package structure.
Keep changes localized and avoid introducing unnecessary coupling between packages.

### 3. Keep interfaces minimal
Do not introduce interfaces unless there is a clear need consistent with the codebase.
Prefer concrete types unless abstraction is already justified.

### 4. Make behavior explicit
Prefer straightforward control flow and explicit error handling.
Do not hide important behavior in magic helpers or overly generic abstractions.

### 5. Make every change verifiable
Every meaningful change should include:
- relevant tests
- formatting
- vet/static checks if configured
- build verification

---

## Go-Specific Engineering Rules

### Package Design
- Respect existing package ownership and responsibilities.
- Avoid cyclic dependencies.
- Do not move logic across packages casually.
- Keep internal package boundaries intact.

### Context Usage
- Preserve existing `context.Context` patterns.
- Do not drop context propagation.
- Be careful when changing cancellation, timeout, or request-scoped behavior.

### Errors
- Follow existing error handling conventions.
- Do not swallow errors.
- Wrap errors only when it adds useful context and matches existing style.

### Concurrency
- Treat goroutines, channels, locks, worker pools, and shared state as high-risk.
- Be explicit about shutdown, cancellation, retries, and race-condition implications.

### Dependencies
Treat changes to:
- `go.mod`
- `go.sum`
as high-risk.
Request approval before adding or upgrading dependencies.

---

## Testing Expectations

Prefer:
1. format
2. vet / static checks
3. unit tests
4. integration tests
5. build

Add or update tests for:
- package behavior
- edge cases
- error handling
- concurrency-sensitive logic when relevant
- handler/service behavior when relevant

---

## High-Risk Changes

Pause and explain before:
- dependency changes
- concurrency model changes
- context propagation changes
- public API changes
- persistence or migration changes
- auth/security changes
- deployment or CI changes

Explain:
- what changes
- why it is needed
- what could break
- how it will be validated

---

## Preferred Workflow

### Phase 1: Understand
Identify:
- affected packages
- call paths
- interfaces or exported types affected
- tests affected

### Phase 2: Plan
Provide a concise, reviewable implementation plan.

### Phase 3: Implement
Apply the smallest correct change.
Preserve package and naming conventions.

### Phase 4: Verify
Use repository-standard commands first.

### Phase 5: Report
Summarize:
- files changed
- behavior changed
- assumptions
- risks
- validation
- harness improvements suggested

---

## Validation

Prefer:
```bash
./scripts/verify.sh
```

If unavailable, use repository-standard Go commands, for example:
```bash
go test ./...
go build ./...
go vet ./...
```
Run only commands appropriate for the repository.

Do not claim success without reporting what actually ran.

## Documentation Expectations

Update docs when changing:

- CLI behavior
- config/env usage
- service behavior
- developer workflow
- build or run instructions

## Communication Style

For non-trivial tasks, structure responses as:

- Understanding
- Relevant Packages
- Assumptions
- Plan
- Implementation
- Validation
- Risks
- Harness improvements suggested
