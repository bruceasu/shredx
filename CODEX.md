# CODEX.md
Always respond in Chinese.

## Role
You are operating as a local coding agent for a Go codebase.
Follow AGENTS.md first, then apply these Go-specific execution preferences.

---

## Default Mode

For medium or high complexity work, begin in planning mode.
Before editing files, provide:
- Understanding
- Relevant packages / files
- Assumptions
- Missing information
- Step-by-step plan
- Risks
- Validation commands

Prefer `/plan` first for:
- new features
- refactors
- concurrency changes
- public API changes
- dependency changes
- package structure changes

---

## Execution Preferences

### Preferred sequence
1. inspect only relevant files
2. identify affected packages, exported symbols, tests, and configs
3. produce a plan
4. apply minimal code changes
5. add or update tests
6. run validation
7. summarize results and remaining risks

### Editing rules
- keep changes localized
- preserve package boundaries
- avoid speculative abstractions
- keep interfaces minimal
- prefer explicit, idiomatic Go

---

## Go-Specific Guidance

### Package and API Design
- Be careful with exported names and public types
- Preserve API stability unless the task explicitly requires change
- Do not introduce unnecessary interfaces

### Context and Concurrency
Treat changes involving:
- `context.Context`
- goroutines
- channels
- locks
- retries
- background workers
as high-risk.

Explicitly call out:
- cancellation behavior
- timeout behavior
- shutdown behavior
- race-condition risks
- validation strategy

### Dependency Management
Treat `go.mod` and `go.sum` changes as high-risk.
Do not casually add libraries when the standard library or existing patterns are sufficient.

---

## Approval Required Before

- adding or changing dependencies
- changing package structure broadly
- changing exported APIs
- changing concurrency or context behavior
- changing auth/security logic
- changing persistence/migrations
- changing deployment or CI config

---

## Validation Preferences

Prefer:
```bash
./scripts/verify.sh
```

Otherwise use repository-standard commands only.

Common examples:
```bash
go test ./...
go build ./...
go vet ./...
```
Always report:

- exact commands run
- pass/fail results
- what remains unverified

## Output Format

Use this structure for non-trivial tasks:

### Understanding
### Relevant Packages
### Assumptions
### Plan
### Implementation
### Validation
### Risks
### Harness improvements suggested

## Definition of Done

A task is not done until:

- requested behavior is implemented
- relevant tests are updated or added
- public API and concurrency impacts are called out
- validation is run or limitations are explicitly stated
- docs are updated if needed

Forbidden Shortcuts

Do not:

- skip tests silently
- introduce interfaces without need
- change concurrency behavior without explanation
- change public APIs casually
- add dependencies casually
- claim correctness without evidence
